What appeared in his sight was a messy ward.\n\nTwo pale-faced nurses curled up in the corner of the ward, shivering. They looked at the kidnapper who had kidnapped a beautiful doctor with horror in their eyes.\n\nNot far from them was the ice-cold corpse of a nurse. Bright red blood stained the ground, and the air was filled with the smell of blood and death.\n\nObviously, the gangster with wolf tattoos had killed a female nurse.\n\nOutside the ward were a large number of police cars and fully armed policemen. The situation was extremely urgent.\n\n\"This is a hospital? What happened? Didn’t I die?\"\n\nYe Xuan was slightly stunned by the surrounding scene, and his face was filled with astonishment.\n\nIn the next moment, a large amount of information surged in his mind.\n\nYe Xuan was 22 years old. He was the heir to Ye’s Group and a well-known black sheep in Star Sea. He had been seriously injured in a car accident three years ago and had been diagnosed as being in a vegetative state by the doctor. If Ye Xuan had not been reborn in this body, he would never have woken up.\n\nOn the other hand, Ye Xuan was once one of the renowned Three Emperors and Five Emperors of the Asura World in the west. He controlled the heavens and the earth and was called the Demon Monarch of a generation!\n\nHe was peerless in Martial Arts and had unparalleled strength. He was regarded by countless people as the Great Emperor who was the most qualified to ascend to the position of Three Emperors!\n\nHe had excellent medical skills, mastered the Holy Book of Medical Knowledge, and practiced the Magical Thirteen Needles. He was known as the Medical Sage in the medical field.\n\nBut in the end, he was betrayed by a traitor and killed by the other four Emperors.\n\nAll of this should have come to an end when Ye Xuan died, but Ye Xuan had never expected that the heavens would favor him so much, allowing him to be reborn and giving him a chance to start all over again.\n\n\"Ah…\"\n\nWith the ear-piercing scream, Ye Xuan gradually came to his senses and looked at the source of the scream.\n\nWhen the gangster with wolf tattoos saw the police’s action, he was irritated. He roared and cut the knife on the beautiful doctor’s neck, leaving a striking bloodstain on her snow-white neck.\n\nBlood gushed out, scaring the nurse next to her. However, the beautiful doctor did not even make a sound."

Leng Qingcheng knew about Ye Xuan’s past life as a great emperor in the Asura World. His power, his medical skills, his unmatched strength... She had heard stories about him when she was younger, but she had never imagined that she would one day find herself by his side.\n\n\"I wonder if he can truly awaken...\" she whispered to herself.\n\nJust as Leng Qingcheng spoke, a small tremor ran through Ye Xuan’s body. A pulse of dark energy erupted from him, sending a surge of shock through the room. His eyes shot open, glowing with an eerie, otherworldly light.\n\n\"What... is this?\" Leng Qingcheng’s heart raced as she watched in disbelief. Ye Xuan’s body was surrounded by a strange aura, his power slowly returning.\n\nFor Ye Xuan, this moment marked the beginning of his journey back to reclaim everything that had once been taken from him."

She knew that this moment was significant, but she didn’t understand how Ye Xuan had awakened.\n\n\"You... you’ve awakened!\" Leng Qingcheng exclaimed, her voice filled with both awe and fear. \"But how?\"\n\nYe Xuan’s eyes flickered with a mysterious light. \"I remember everything. I was reborn. The knowledge... the skills... they’re all still within me. And with them, I will exact my revenge.\"\n\nWith a subtle motion of his hand, Ye Xuan summoned a needle from thin air—a needle crafted from pure energy.

She was a villain from his past life, someone who had betrayed him and caused his downfall.\n\n\"Li Yun, you’re still here?\" Ye Xuan’s voice was laced with contempt as he stared at the woman who had once been his ally.\n\nLi Yun smirked, her eyes filled with malice. \"Of course I’m here. You think you can just walk out without consequences?\"\n\nYe Xuan’s eyes flared with rage. He raised his hand, and the power of the Magical Thirteen Needles surged around him. With a flick of his wrist, he sent a pulse of energy toward Li Yun, sending her sprawling to the ground.\n\n\"You will regret crossing me,\" Ye Xuan whispered, before turning and walking out of the hospital."

The Immortal Emperor, once the ruler of countless realms, opened his eyes to a world vastly different from the one he had left behind. His surroundings were simple—a wooden bed, a single flickering candle, and the muffled sounds of a small village bustling outside. As his awareness returned, he realized he had been reborn into the frail body of a young scholar named Lin Tian. His limbs felt weak, and his once-mighty cultivation was nowhere to be found. Yet, his mind remained sharp, brimming with memories of millennia of battles and triumphs.\n\nA soft knock at the door interrupted his thoughts. It creaked open to reveal an elderly man with a kind but weathered face. “Lin Tian,” the man said, his voice trembling slightly, “the village elder has summoned everyone to the square. There’s troubling news.” Lin Tian nodded, concealing the turmoil within. He followed the man to the square, where villagers whispered of an impending attack by a notorious bandit gang. Though his power was sealed, the Emperor within him stirred, and a flicker of his indomitable spirit returned. If these mortals thought they could rob and terrorize the people under his watch, they were gravely mistaken."

His sharp eyes caught sight of the Bandit King leading the charge, a massive man adorned with scars and a malicious grin. Behind him, a horde of ruthless men shouted and brandished weapons, ready to pillage and destroy.\n\n\"Stay together,\" Lin Tian commanded, his voice steady and firm. The villagers hesitated, unsure of how to respond to the frail scholar who had always been seen as an outcast. But something in his tone carried authority, compelling them to obey. Lin Tian quickly assessed the layout of the village, noting choke points and natural defenses. With a stick he picked up from the ground, he began sketching a strategy in the dirt, instructing the villagers to use carts and barrels to create barricades and prepare rudimentary weapons.\n\nAs the bandits stormed into the village, chaos erupted. Yet, Lin Tian’s strategy unfolded with precision. Villagers fought bravely, using the traps and tactics he devised. Even as the Bandit King smashed through defenses, Lin Tian stood his ground. With no cultivation to rely on, he used his sharp mind and agility to evade attacks and lead the counteroffensive. The battle raged on, and by nightfall, the bandits were in full retreat, leaving the village scarred but victorious."

Inside, amidst a collection of forgotten relics, lay an ancient scroll sealed with a faint aura of power. The moment Lin Tian touched the scroll, a surge of energy coursed through him, and fragments of his sealed memories unlocked. The markings on the scroll revealed a long-lost cultivation technique, one that resonated deeply with his immortal soul.\n\nAs he studied the scroll, visions of his past life surfaced. He remembered the treachery that led to his fall—the allies who betrayed him, the empires that crumbled in his absence. But the scroll also hinted at a path to reclaim his power. Hidden within its cryptic verses was the key to breaking the seal that bound him, but it would require immense effort and perilous journeys.

Rumors of rebellion and dark forces whispered through the land, and Lin Tian knew his path would lead him there eventually.\n\nAs he set out, he encountered a group of mercenaries harassing a lone traveler on the road. The traveler was a woman dressed in tattered robes, her face partially hidden by a hood. Without hesitation, Lin Tian intervened, his sharp mind compensating for his lack of cultivation. Using the terrain and quick thinking, he outmaneuvered the mercenaries, forcing them to flee.\n\nThe woman introduced herself as Yue Qing, a healer seeking redemption for a tragic past. Intrigued by her resolve and sensing a kindred spirit, Lin Tian invited her to join him. Together, they traveled through treacherous landscapes, facing both natural dangers and hostile forces. Along the way, Yue Qing’s healing skills proved invaluable, and Lin Tian began to see her as more than an ally. Their bond deepened, and her presence reignited a spark of humanity within the Emperor’s hardened soul."

But the guardian, a man known only as the Crimson Blade, was no ordinary opponent.\n\nAs Lin Tian and Yue Qing ascended the mountain, they faced traps and trials designed to test their resolve. When they finally reached the summit, the Crimson Blade greeted them with a thunderous laugh. \"If you seek the relic, you must prove your worth in combat,\" he declared, drawing a massive sword that glowed with an eerie light.\n\nThe duel that followed was nothing short of extraordinary. Lin Tian, armed only with his wits and the techniques he had gleaned from the hidden scroll, faced off against the seasoned warrior. Each strike and parry was calculated, a testament to the Emperor’s brilliance in combat. Despite his mortal limitations, Lin Tian’s strategies outmatched the Crimson Blade’s raw power.

To the untrained eye, it was just a jumble of plants, but to the Divine Doctor, it was a treasure trove of medicinal wonders.\n\n\"Daddy, why are you staring at the plants?\" Little Ning asked, tilting her head curiously. \"These herbs… they’re not just plants,\" Zhang Wei murmured. \"They’re lifesavers.\" Before he could explain further, a commotion broke out nearby. A man had collapsed, clutching his chest. People gathered around in panic, but no one knew what to do.

Without hesitation, he grabbed a handful of herbs from the stall and prepared a makeshift concoction. The stall owner protested, but Zhang Wei silenced him with a steely glare. Carefully administering the remedy and applying acupressure, Zhang Wei worked swiftly. Within minutes, the man gasped, his breathing steadying as color returned to his face. The crowd erupted in cheers and disbelief. Zhang Wei, however, remained calm, his thoughts focused on the future. This was only the beginning of his return to the world of miracles."

They don’t know how to treat it. We’ve tried everything, but… he’s getting worse.\"\n\nZhang Wei placed his hand on the boy’s wrist, closing his eyes.

But he couldn’t let that world interfere with the life he had built for Mengmeng.\n\nReaching into his pocket, he pulled out a small, worn medallion—a relic from his previous life. It pulsed faintly with energy, a reminder of the power he had once wielded. Zhang Han clenched it in his fist. \"If they want the Sky Sovereign, they’ll have to get through me first.\"\n\nAs the city lights flickered outside, Zhang Han made a silent vow. He would embrace his past, not to reclaim his former glory, but to protect the life he had now. For Mengmeng, he would become a godly stay-home dad unlike any other. And if the realms thought they could take her away from him, they were in for a rude awakening."

His name was Ye Qing, a swordsman whose life had been riddled with tragedy and betrayal. \n\nClutching the hilt of a simple, weathered sword, Ye Qing stared out at the endless horizon. The wind howled around him, carrying the scent of blood and ash—a reminder of the massacre that had wiped out his clan three years ago. The once-proud Ye Clan, renowned for their mastery of the blade, had been reduced to nothing more than a memory.\n\nYe Qing’s grip tightened on the sword, his knuckles turning white. This weapon was the last relic of his family, a blade said to contain the soul of the Venerable Sword God—a legendary figure who had once ruled the heavens with his unparalleled swordsmanship. \"I swear,\" Ye Qing muttered under his breath, his voice trembling with emotion, \"I will avenge them. I will rebuild the Ye Clan, even if it costs me my life.\"\n\nAs if in response to his vow, the sword began to hum faintly, its dull surface glowing with a faint silver light. Ye Qing’s eyes widened in shock. Before he could react, the sword’s energy surged into his body, flooding his veins with a power unlike anything he had ever felt. Memories of ancient battles and profound sword techniques flooded his mind, overwhelming him. \"This... this is the inheritance of the Sword God,\" he realized, his heart pounding. \n\nBut the moment was short-lived. A sharp, mocking laugh echoed from behind him. \"Well, well, if it isn’t the last survivor of the Ye Clan,\" a voice sneered. Ye Qing turned to see a group of men emerging from the shadows, their leader wielding a blood-stained blade. \"Hand over the sword, boy. A weakling like you doesn’t deserve such power.\"\n\nYe Qing’s jaw clenched, his fear replaced by a burning determination. He raised the sword, its newfound power coursing through him. \"If you want this sword,\" he said, his voice steady and cold, \"you’ll have to take it from my dead hands.\" The battle that followed would mark the beginning of Ye Qing’s journey to reclaim his family’s honor and ascend to the pinnacle of the sword path."

Around him lay the bodies of his attackers, their blood soaking into the earth. The leader of the group, a man known as Black Blade, groaned in pain as he clutched a deep gash in his chest. \n\n\"You... How did you...\" Black Blade’s voice was weak, his eyes filled with disbelief. Ye Qing, a boy barely old enough to be called a man, had defeated him—a seasoned warrior feared throughout the Azure Continent. \n\nYe Qing didn’t respond. His gaze was fixed on his sword, which now pulsed with a steady light. He could feel it—an intelligence, a soul within the blade that resonated with his own. \"You’ve awakened me,\" a deep, resonant voice echoed in his mind. \"I am the Sword Soul, the essence of the Venerable Sword God. Together, we will carve a path through the heavens.\"\n\nYe Qing’s heart raced. The power he had tapped into during the fight wasn’t his own—it was the Sword Soul guiding him, lending him strength and skill beyond his years. But this power came with a price. \"You must prove yourself worthy,\" the Sword Soul warned. \"The road ahead is fraught with peril. Betrayal, bloodshed, and heartbreak await you. But if you endure, you will rise above them all.\"\n\nBlack Blade coughed, snapping Ye Qing out of his thoughts. \"Mercy,\" the man pleaded, his arrogance replaced by desperation. Ye Qing hesitated. The Sword Soul’s voice was cold and unyielding. \"A sword does not spare its enemies. Strike him down.\"\n\nYe Qing’s hand trembled as he raised his blade. He had never taken a life before, but the memory of his family’s slaughter burned in his mind. With a single, swift motion, he ended Black Blade’s life. As the man’s body slumped to the ground, Ye Qing felt a strange mix of triumph and sorrow. This was his first step on the path of vengeance—and there was no turning back."

Their leader, a young woman named Ling Xue, stepped forward. She was graceful and poised, her piercing eyes studying Ye Qing with curiosity. \n\n\"Ye Qing,\" she said, her voice firm but not unkind. \"The Azure Sword Sect has taken an interest in you. Your battle with Black Blade demonstrated not only your skill but also your potential. We invite you to join us and hone your abilities under the guidance of our elders.\"\n\nYe Qing frowned. He had little interest in aligning himself with another faction. His trust in others had been shattered the day his family was betrayed. But Ling Xue seemed to sense his hesitation. \"The Azure Sword Sect values strength above all else,\" she continued. \"If you seek vengeance for your clan, we can help you grow strong enough to achieve it.\"\n\nThe mention of vengeance struck a chord in Ye Qing. He glanced at his sword, its surface reflecting his conflicted expression. The Sword Soul’s voice echoed in his mind. \"Accept their offer. The knowledge and resources of the sect will accelerate your growth. But tread carefully. Alliances can be both a boon and a burden.\"\n\nAfter a moment’s thought, Ye Qing nodded. \"Very well,\" he said. \"I’ll join your sect. But know this—I walk my own path. I won’t bow to anyone’s will but my own.\"\n\nLing Xue smiled faintly. \"That’s precisely the kind of spirit we admire. Welcome to the Azure Sword Sect, Ye Qing.\" And so, Ye Qing took his first step into a world of powerful allies, dangerous rivals, and secrets that would challenge everything he thought he knew about the art of the sword—and himself."

Those who fail will be sent away.\"\n\nThe trial took place in the sect’s arena, a massive stone platform surrounded by towering statues of legendary swordsmen. The initiates were paired off for combat, their skills evaluated by the elders. When Ye Qing’s turn came, he faced a burly young man wielding a massive broadsword. \n\nThe match began, and the air was filled with the sound of clashing blades. Ye Qing’s movements were fluid and precise, his swordsmanship honed by the guidance of the Sword Soul. His opponent, while powerful, lacked the finesse and strategy to match Ye Qing’s speed. Within minutes, Ye Qing disarmed him, his blade stopping mere inches from the man’s throat.\n\nThe elder watching the match nodded in approval. \"Impressive,\" he said. \"Ye Qing, you pass the first trial. But remember—this is only the beginning. The path of the sword is endless, and the challenges ahead will test you in ways you cannot yet imagine.\"\n\nAs Ye Qing stepped off the platform, he felt a surge of pride. But he also knew that his journey was far from over. The Azure Sword Sect held the key to his growth, but it also harbored secrets that could shape his destiny in ways he could never have anticipated."

His body, once strong and vibrant, now lay motionless within a mysterious tomb, surrounded by runes of power, their light slowly fading with time. For centuries, Xian Feng had been trapped in a curse, a consequence of his attempt to unravel the secrets of immortality.\n\n'Awake,' a soft voice whispered, as a strange energy coursed through Xian Feng's body. His eyes fluttered open, revealing a pair of glowing amber pupils, the marks of an immortal's bloodline. The tomb around him began to tremble as though it was alive, and with a powerful surge, Xian Feng shattered the barriers that had bound him for centuries.\n\n'Where am I?' he muttered, standing up, his body aching from years of dormancy. He reached out to touch the ancient stone walls, his fingertips crackling with energy. The last thing he remembered was his failed attempt to attain immortality—he had delved too deep into forbidden knowledge, and in doing so, had inadvertently caused the great disaster.\n\nAs Xian Feng stepped outside the tomb, the vast expanse of the Immortal Kingdom greeted him. The land was desolate, the skies filled with dark clouds that seemed to weep for the once-great empire now in ruins. 'The world has changed,' he thought to himself. 'But how far has it fallen since the disaster?'\n\nHe could feel the curse of immortality burning within his soul, the knowledge of a power that could either save the world or destroy it. But for now, all he could do was survive. And perhaps, in time, reclaim what was lost."

They were weak, broken people, scavengers who had once been proud immortals or descendants of powerful clans. Now, they were nothing more than husks, cursed by the same disaster that had befallen Xian Feng.\n\nA woman, gaunt and disheveled, approached him as he passed through the remains of a city. Her eyes were empty, devoid of hope, and her voice trembled as she spoke. \"You... you're one of them, aren't you? A true immortal?\"\n\nXian Feng stopped in his tracks, studying the woman. She had the markings of the ancient Immortal Sect—an organization that once held sway over the world—but now, it was but a shadow of its former self.\n\n\"I was once,\" Xian Feng replied, his voice cold and distant. \"But that was before the disaster. Before everything fell apart.\"\n\nThe woman’s eyes widened in recognition. \"The Immortal’s Curse... You... you were the one who caused it.\"\n\nXian Feng recoiled, the words striking him like a blade. He hadn’t wanted to cause harm, but the pursuit of immortality had clouded his judgment. The curse that now ravaged the world was his doing, and he could not escape it.\n\n\"What do you want from me?\" he asked, his tone sharp.\n\nThe woman lowered her gaze. \"I seek redemption. I want to undo what you have done.\"\n\nXian Feng stared at her, his mind racing. Could it be possible to reverse the disaster, to restore the world? He didn’t know. But one thing was certain: the Immortal Path was broken, and it was up to him to fix it—or see the world fall into eternal darkness."

Mei Lan explained that the survivors had formed an alliance to find a way to lift the curse, but they were divided, their minds clouded by despair and their hearts consumed by anger.\n\nAs Xian Feng entered the heart of the camp, he was greeted by a group of powerful but wary individuals. There was Tian Long, a towering warrior who had once commanded legions of immortals, now reduced to a broken shell of his former self. There was also Li Mei, a brilliant strategist who had once held sway over the fate of nations, but now, her once-sharp mind was dulled by the curse.\n\n\"Who is this?\" Tian Long growled, eyeing Xian Feng with distrust. His massive frame seemed to exude an aura of untamed fury, as though he were ready to tear the world apart.\n\nMei Lan stepped forward, speaking softly but firmly. \"This is Xian Feng. He was the cause of the Immortal’s Curse, but he may also be our salvation.\"\n\nThe words hung in the air like a dagger, and the group fell into an uncomfortable silence. Xian Feng felt the weight of their gazes, each one filled with hatred and sorrow. The curse had taken everything from them, and they blamed him for it.\n\nBut Xian Feng was no longer the naive young man who had sought immortality without understanding its consequences. He had witnessed the horrors caused by his actions, and he was willing to do whatever it took to make things right.\n\n\"If we are to stop the curse,\" Xian Feng said, his voice steady, \"we must unite. The Immortal Kingdom may be gone, but there is still hope—if we can find the source of the curse and destroy it, we can restore what was lost.\"\n\nTian Long growled, his fists clenched. \"And what makes you think you can undo the disaster you caused?\"\n\nXian Feng met his gaze, his amber eyes burning with a fierce determination. \"Because I am the only one who can.\"\n\nThe silence that followed was thick with tension, but the seeds of hope had been planted. The Fallen were divided, but perhaps, just perhaps, they could rise again."

Legends spoke of an ancient temple hidden deep within the mountain, where the Immortal’s Curse had first been unleashed.\n\nBut as they journeyed deeper into the land, Xian Feng could feel the curse growing stronger. The skies darkened, and strange creatures, twisted by the curse, appeared to challenge their progress. The once-beautiful forests were now barren wastelands, and the air was thick with the scent of decay.\n\nTian Long, who had been silent for most of the journey, finally spoke. \"Do you really think we can undo what has been done?\" His voice was laced with doubt, but there was also a hint of longing.\n\nXian Feng’s gaze never wavered as he looked ahead. \"I have to believe we can. For the sake of the Immortal Kingdom, for the sake of those we lost, we must try.\"\n\nWith each passing day, the group grew closer to the Forbidden Mountain, but the journey was taking its toll. Mei Lan had grown weaker, her energy drained by the curse, and even Xian Feng felt the weight of the world pressing down on him.

But something in his tone intrigued her.\n\n\"What do they want?\" she asked, almost involuntarily.\n\nMu Zhen stared at her for a long moment, as if considering how much to reveal. Finally, he spoke.\n\n\"They want to control me. They think I’m still a pawn in their game. But I won’t let them win. Not this time.\"\n\nLi Yan felt a strange sense of solidarity. She knew all too well what it was like to be controlled by those who thought they knew what was best for her."

The initial disdain she had felt for him—his arrogance, his aloofness—slowly turned into something else. Despite their marriage being a complete lie, there were moments where their chemistry felt real.\n\nShe caught herself staring at him when he wasn’t looking, wondering about the man behind the façade. She found herself laughing at his dry humor and even enjoying their conversations. But every time she began to think she might be developing feelings for him, she quickly reminded herself that this was all part of the plan. She wasn’t supposed to fall for him.\n\nOne night, as they sat together, sharing a quiet dinner after a long day of pretending, Mu Zhen broke the silence.\n\n\"Li Yan,\" he said softly, his tone unusually serious. \"Do you ever think... that this might not just be a lie anymore?\"\n\nHer heart skipped a beat. Was he confessing something?\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked, her voice almost a whisper.\n\nHe looked at her, his gaze intense. \"I mean... maybe we’re both fooling ourselves. Maybe we’re starting to care about each other.\"\n\nLi Yan’s breath caught in her throat. The words hung in the air, and for a moment, everything felt real. But then, just as quickly, Mu Zhen stood up, breaking the moment.\n\n\"Forget I said anything,\" he muttered, walking away.\n\nLi Yan sat frozen, her heart racing. Was he serious? Or was this just another game?"

The deeper she dug, the more unsettling the truths became.\n\nMu Zhen’s family wasn’t just wealthy; they were powerful, and their business empire was built on deceit and manipulation. They had orchestrated the marriage as part of a larger plan to control Mu Zhen’s inheritance and legacy.\n\nLi Yan couldn’t believe what she was learning. Mu Zhen had been trapped in this world of lies and power games from the very beginning. And yet, despite everything, he had never truly given up on the idea of freedom.\n\nOne evening, she confronted him.\n\n\"Mu Zhen, tell me the truth. Why did you really want to marry me? Was it just for convenience? Or did you have other reasons?\"\n\nHe looked at her for a long moment, his expression unreadable.\n\n\"I wanted to protect you,\" he said finally. \"I wanted to save you from the same fate I’ve suffered—being controlled by people who don’t care about us.\"\n\nThe weight of his words hit her like a ton of bricks. She had always thought she was the one being deceived, but now she realized that they were both victims in this twisted game."

She had spent so long questioning his motives, but now, with everything out in the open, she found herself asking a different question altogether.\n\n\"Mu Zhen... what happens now?\" she asked softly.\n\nHe smiled, the first genuine smile she had seen in a long time.\n\n\"Now? Now, we start over. This time, no lies, no games. Just us.\"\n\nAnd with that, Li Yan finally understood.

Their future together was uncertain, but for the first time, it felt like it was truly theirs."
